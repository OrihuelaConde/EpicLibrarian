**Epic Librarian** is a PowerShell 7 utility designed to **move Epic Games installations between drives** while keeping them playable through symbolic links.  
It helps free up space on your system drive without breaking your games, and now supports **two-way moves**:  
- From the default Epic Games folder to another drive.  
- From the secondary drive back to the original location.  

It was crafted with care by [Jos√© Luis Orihuela Conde](https://github.com/OrihuelaConde) and Microsoft Copilot, iteratively refined for stability, usability, and speed.
